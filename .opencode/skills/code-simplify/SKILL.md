# Code Simplification

Announce: "I'm using the /code-simplify skill to simplify code for clarity and maintainability."

## Hard Rules

- **Never change behavior.** Simplification preserves exact functionality. If a change might alter behavior, skip it.
- **Verify after every batch.** Run project-specific checks (linters, type checkers, tests) after each batch of files.
  Never mark a batch complete if checks fail.
- **One file per agent.** Each file gets its own `productivity:code-simplifier` subagent.
  Agents must not modify files outside their assignment.
- **Track everything.** The tracking file is the source of truth for progress.
  Always update it after each batch completes.

## Step 1: Detect Scope

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine what to simplify.

| Argument | Scope | File enumeration |
|-|-|-|
| File path (e.g., `src/auth.ts`) | Single file | That file only |
| Directory path (e.g., `src/auth/`) | Directory | All source files in that directory (non-recursive) |
| Directory path with `**` (e.g., `src/auth/**`) | Directory recursive | All source files recursively |
| `--branch` or no arguments | Branch diff | Files changed on current branch vs default branch |
| `--staged` | Staged files | Files in the git staging area |
| `--repo` | Entire repo | All source files in the repo |
| `--package <name>` | Package/module | Files in the named package, module, or workspace member |
| `--diff <ref>` | Diff since ref | Files changed since the given git ref |

### Scope resolution

**Default branch detection** (for `--branch` scope):

```bash
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' || echo "main"
```

**File enumeration by scope:**

```bash
# --branch (default)
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR "$(git merge-base HEAD origin/<default-branch>)"..HEAD

# --staged
git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR

# --diff <ref>
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR "<ref>"..HEAD

# --repo
git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard

# --package <name> — resolve package root, then enumerate
# Language-specific: look for package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pyproject.toml, etc.
```

**Filter to source files only.** Exclude:
- Binary files, images, fonts
- Generated files (`*.gen.*`, `*.pb.go`, `*_generated.*`, vendor/, node_modules/, dist/, build/)
- Lock files (`package-lock.json`, `Cargo.lock`, `go.sum`, `poetry.lock`)
- Configuration files (`*.json`, `*.yaml`, `*.yml`, `*.toml`, `*.xml`) unless they contain logic
- Markdown, documentation, and license files
- Test fixtures and snapshots (`__fixtures__/`, `__snapshots__/`, `testdata/`)

**If no source files found for the given scope:** inform the user and stop.

## Step 2: Detect Tech Stack

Auto-detect the project's language and verification commands.

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

Run these detection checks in parallel:

| Indicator | Language | Checks to add |
|-|-|-|
| `Cargo.toml` at root | Rust | `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo check` |
| `go.mod` at root | Go | `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...` |
| `package.json` with `tsc` dep | TypeScript | `npx tsc --noEmit` |
| `package.json` with `eslint` script | JS/TS | `npm run lint` or the eslint command |
| `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` | Python | `ruff check .` (or `flake8`) |
| `Makefile` with `lint` target | Any | `make lint` |
| `Makefile` with `check` target | Any | `make check` |
| `Makefile` with `test` target | Any | `make test` |

**If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--checks "<cmd1>,<cmd2>"`:** use those commands instead of auto-detected ones.

**If no checks detected and none specified:** warn the user that no verification checks were found.
Ask whether to proceed without checks or provide check commands.

Store the check list for Step 5.

## Step 3: Initialize or Resume Tracking

The tracking file enables resuming across sessions and loop compatibility.

```bash
REPO_NAME=$(basename "$REPO_ROOT")
TRACKING_FILE="/tmp/code-simplify-${REPO_NAME}.md"
```

### Resume: tracking file exists and `--reset` not in arguments

Read the tracking file. Count pending files (`- [ ]`).

| State | Action |
|-|-|
| Pending files exist | Resume from pending files (Step 4) |
| All files marked `[x]` or `[-]` | Output `ALL COMPLETE` message and stop |
| Scope mismatch (different scope than current arguments) | Warn user and ask: resume existing or start fresh? |

### Fresh start: no tracking file or `--reset`

Create the tracking file:

```markdown
# Code Simplification: <repo-name>

**Scope:** <scope description>
**Created:** <ISO timestamp>
**Tech stack:** <detected language(s)>
**Checks:** <comma-separated check commands>

## Files

- [ ] path/to/file1.ext
- [ ] path/to/file2.ext
...
```

**Sort files by directory** so related files are processed together,
increasing the chance that convention context is warm in each agent's exploration.

## Step 4: Batch Process

Pick the next batch of pending files from the tracking file — up to 10 files at once.

For each file in the batch, launch a `productivity:code-simplifier` agent in the background:

```
Task(
  subagent = "code-simplifier",
  description = "Simplify: <filename>",
  run_in_background = true,
  prompt = "
<assignment>
Simplify this file: <absolute-file-path>
Repository root: <REPO_ROOT>
</assignment>

<context>
Language: <detected language>
Project conventions: Read CLAUDE.md and .claude/rules/ at the repo root.
Compare with 2-3 sibling files in the same directory before making changes.
</context>

<constraints>
- Modify ONLY the assigned file — no other files.
- Preserve all functionality — no behavior changes.
- Do not commit changes.
- Do not add comments, docstrings, or type annotations to unchanged code.
- Return a structured report listing every change applied.
</constraints>
"
)
```

Wait for all agents in the batch to complete.
As each agent completes, record its report (changes applied, skipped, metrics).

**If an agent fails (timeout or error):** log the failure against that file,
mark it as `[!]` in the tracking file, and continue with the rest of the batch.

## Step 5: Verify

After the entire batch completes, run ALL verification checks from Step 2:

```bash
# Run each check command sequentially
<check-command-1>
<check-command-2>
...
```

### If all checks pass

Proceed to Step 6.

### If any check fails

1. Read the error output to identify which files and what broke.
2. Fix the issues inline — targeted edits only, no broad rewrites.
3. Re-run the failing checks.
4. Maximum 3 fix iterations per batch. If still failing after 3 attempts:
   - Revert the problematic file(s) with `git checkout -- <file>`.
   - Mark those files as `[!] <filename> -- reverted: <reason>` in the tracking file.
   - Continue with the next batch.

## Step 6: Update Tracking

For each file in the completed batch, update the tracking file:

| Outcome | Marker | Format |
|-|-|-|
| Changes applied | `[x]` | `- [x] path/to/file.ext -- <brief summary of changes> (N changes)` |
| No changes needed | `[-]` | `- [-] path/to/file.ext -- no changes needed` |
| Failed/reverted | `[!]` | `- [!] path/to/file.ext -- reverted: <reason>` |

### Check completion

Count remaining `- [ ]` entries.

| Remaining | Action |
|-|-|
| More pending files | Return to Step 4 for the next batch |
| None remaining | Proceed to Step 7 |

## Step 7: Report

Present a summary of all simplification work:

```markdown
## Code Simplification Complete

**Scope:** <scope description>
**Files processed:** N total (M simplified, K unchanged, J failed)
**Tracking file:** /tmp/code-simplify-<repo-name>.md

### Changes by Category
| Category | Count |
|-|-|
| Dead code removal | N |
| Complexity reduction | N |
| Naming improvements | N |
| Control flow | N |
| Magic values | N |
| ... | ... |

### Files Simplified
1. `path/to/file.ext` -- <summary> (N changes)
2. ...

### Files Unchanged
- `path/to/file.ext` -- no changes needed

### Files Failed
- `path/to/file.ext` -- reverted: <reason>

### Verification
All checks passed: <yes/no>
```

Omit any section with no entries.

**If running in a loop** (invoked via the loop skill):
output `ALL COMPLETE -- cancel this loop with CronDelete` as the final line.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-|-|
| No source files found for scope | Inform user with the scope used and suggest alternatives |
| File path does not exist | Report the exact path and stop |
| Package/module not found | List available packages and ask user to pick one |
| No verification checks detected | Warn and ask: proceed without checks or provide commands? |
| Agent timeout on a file | Mark file as `[!]` with timeout reason, continue with batch |
| Verification fails after 3 fix attempts | Revert problematic files, mark as `[!]`, continue |
| Tracking file exists with different scope | Ask user: resume existing scope or `--reset` for fresh start |
| Git not available | Inform user that git is required for branch/staged/diff scopes |
| `--repo` on large codebase (>500 files) | Warn user about the scale, ask for confirmation before proceeding |
