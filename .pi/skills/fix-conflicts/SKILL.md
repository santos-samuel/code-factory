# Fix Conflicts

Announce: "I'm using the fix-conflicts skill to resolve merge conflicts."

## Step 1: Detect Conflict State

Run the conflict state detector:

```bash
./scripts/get-conflict-state.sh
```

The output shows the operation type (merge, rebase, revert, cherry-pick), conflicted files with their conflict types, and branch context.

**If Operation is "none" and no conflicted files:** inform the user there are no conflicts to resolve and stop.

**If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a file:** limit resolution scope to that file only (verify it appears in the conflicted list).

## Step 2: Read Conflicted Files

Read every conflicted file listed in Step 1. For large files (>500 lines), focus on sections containing conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).

Then gather history context to understand what each side intended:

```bash
# Local commits that touched conflicted files
./scripts/get-conflict-history.sh local

# Remote commits that touched conflicted files
./scripts/get-conflict-history.sh remote
```

For each commit listed in the history output, inspect its actual diff to understand intent:

```bash
# Show the full diff for a specific commit touching the conflicted file
git show <commit-sha> -- <conflicted-file>
```

Pay attention to:
- **Additions**: new code, new functions, new parameters
- **Removals**: deleted code, removed functions, removed parameters —
  note whether the commit message explains the removal (refactor, deprecation, cleanup)
  or whether the removal looks incidental to a larger change
- **Modifications**: changed logic, renamed symbols, updated signatures

For each conflict, determine:

| Question | How to answer |
|----------|---------------|
| What did the local side change? | `git show` each local commit touching the file; inspect code between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` |
| What did the remote side change? | `git show` each remote commit touching the file; inspect code between `=======` and `>>>>>>>` |
| Did either side intentionally remove code? | Check if the removal was in a dedicated commit (refactor/cleanup/deprecation) vs. incidental to a larger change |
| Are changes independent? | Different logical concerns = keep both |
| Are changes contradictory? | Same logic changed differently = need judgment |

## Step 3: Resolve by Conflict Type

### Rebase conflict orientation (CRITICAL)

During `git rebase`, ours/theirs are **reversed** from merge:

| Side | Merge | Rebase |
|------|-------|--------|
| `<<<<<<< HEAD` (ours) | Your branch | **Upstream** (e.g., main) |
| `=======` → `>>>>>>>` (theirs) | Incoming branch | **Your feature branch** |

The code between `=======` and `>>>>>>>` is YOUR feature branch work.
**Never discard it without explicit user confirmation** — doing so silently loses changes you wrote.

Resolution posture during rebase:
1. Treat the theirs section as the change you must land; treat the ours section as context to integrate around it.
2. If both sides modified the same lines with incompatible intent, ask the user (see "When uncertain" below).
3. "Upstream looks newer/cleaner" is NOT sufficient justification to drop theirs.

### Standard conflicts (UU — both modified, AA — both added)

1. Understand intent of both sides from history and surrounding code.
2. Choose resolution strategy:

| Situation | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Changes are independent (different functions, different lines) | Merge both — keep all changes |
| Changes overlap but complement each other | Combine intelligently — integrate both intents |
| Changes contradict each other | Ask the user (see "When uncertain" below) |
| One side is strictly newer/better | `git show` both sides' commits — only keep one side if the other's changes are already included or purely cosmetic. During rebase, verify "better" is not just upstream recency. |

3. Remove ALL conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
4. Verify the result is syntactically correct.

### Intent preservation rules (apply to ALL conflict types)

Before writing the resolved version of any conflict, complete this checklist:

1. **List both sides' meaningful changes.**
   For each side, write a one-line summary of what it intended (from Step 2's `git show` analysis).
2. **Verify no silent drops.**
   If you are keeping only one side's text, confirm the other side made no substantive changes
   (logic, behavior, API) in that region. Formatting-only or whitespace-only differences are safe to drop.
3. **Respect intentional removals.**
   If one side removed code that the other side still has (or modified):
   - `git show` the commit that performed the removal.
   - If the commit message or diff shows a deliberate action (refactor, deprecation, dead-code cleanup,
     feature removal), **do not re-add the removed code** — the removal wins.
   - If the removal looks incidental (part of a large unrelated change, no mention in the commit message),
     ask the user whether the removal was intentional.
4. **Never re-add intentionally deleted code.**
   Code that was removed in a dedicated cleanup or refactor commit must stay removed,
   even if the other side's conflict block still contains it.

| Rationalization | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "I'll keep both sides to be safe" | Re-adding intentionally deleted code is not safe — it reverses a deliberate decision |
| "The other side still has it, so it must be needed" | The other side's branch may predate the removal |
| "One side is newer so I'll take that whole block" | The older side may contain additions the newer side never saw |

### Wholesale side selection guardrails

Taking an entire side (`--ours` / `--theirs` or keeping one conflict block verbatim) is only safe when
the other side's changes in that region are trivially reconcilable.

| Safe to take one side wholesale | NOT safe — must merge manually |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Other side's changes are formatting/whitespace only | Both sides have substantive logic changes |
| Other side only reordered imports | Both sides added new code in the same region |
| Conflict is in a generated or lock file (will be regenerated) | One side removed code the other side modified |
| One side's change is a strict subset of the other | Both sides changed function signatures differently |

Before selecting a whole side, run `git show <commit> -- <file>` for the side you would drop
and confirm its changes are present elsewhere or are not meaningful.

### Modify/delete conflicts (UD — modified locally/deleted remotely, DU — deleted locally/modified remotely)

1. Identify which side deleted and which modified.
2. Inspect the deletion commit to determine intent:

```bash
# Find the commit that deleted the file on the deleting side
git log --diff-filter=D --oneline -1 -- <file>

# Examine the commit to understand why
git show <deletion-commit-sha>
```

3. Classify the deletion:

| Deletion context | Resolution |
|-----------------|------------|
| Dedicated cleanup/refactor commit (message says "remove", "deprecate", "delete", "clean up") | Deletion was intentional — default to deleting unless the modification is critical new work |
| Feature commit that reorganized code (moved, not removed) | Check where the code moved to; merge the modification into the new location |
| Incidental to a large commit with no mention in the message | Ask the user — deletion may have been accidental |

4. If still uncertain, ask the user:

<interaction>
AskUserQuestion(
  header: "Keep or delete?",
  question: "<file> was modified on one side but deleted on the other. The modification: <brief description>. The deletion was in commit <sha>: <message>. The deletion appears <intentional|incidental>. Keep the modified version or delete?",
  options: [
    "Keep modified" -- Stage the modified version with git add,
    "Delete" -- Stage deletion with git rm
  ]
)
</interaction>

### Add conflicts (AU — added by us, UA — added by them)

1. Review the added file's content and purpose.
2. If keeping: `git add <file>`
3. If removing: `git rm <file>`
4. If both sides added with different content: treat as a standard UU conflict.

### When uncertain about any conflict

**Do NOT guess about business logic.** Ask the user.

For **merge** conflicts:

<interaction>
AskUserQuestion(
  header: "Conflict choice",
  question: "Conflict in <file>: <brief description of both sides>. How should this be resolved?",
  options: [
    "Keep local (ours)" -- Use the local/HEAD version,
    "Keep remote (theirs)" -- Use the incoming version,
    "Merge both" -- Combine changes from both sides,
    "Leave unresolved" -- Skip this file for manual resolution
  ]
)
</interaction>

For **rebase** conflicts (ours = upstream, theirs = your feature branch):

<interaction>
AskUserQuestion(
  header: "Conflict choice (rebase)",
  question: "Conflict in <file> while replaying your commit '<commit message>'. Upstream (HEAD) has: <ours summary>. Your branch has: <theirs summary>. How should this be resolved?",
  options: [
    "Keep your branch change (theirs)" -- Preserve your feature branch work,
    "Keep upstream (ours)" -- Discard your branch's version for this section,
    "Merge both" -- Combine both sides,
    "Leave unresolved" -- Skip this file for manual resolution
  ]
)
</interaction>

### Version and changelog conflicts

When a version field or changelog conflicts, the upstream (main) side has released a new version. **NEVER merge version entries.** The upstream release history is immutable.

**Resolution rule:** Keep all upstream version entries and release notes exactly as they are. Bump your version to be strictly above the upstream version, then add your changelog entry as the newest.

| File | How to resolve |
|------|---------------|
| **Version fields** (package.json `version`, plugin.json `version`, Cargo.toml `version`, pyproject.toml `version`) | Take the upstream version. If your version was equal or higher, bump to the next appropriate semver above upstream (e.g., upstream released `1.3.0`, your branch had `1.3.0` -> bump to `1.4.0`). |
| **Changelogs** (CHANGELOG.md, HISTORY.md, CHANGES.md) | Keep ALL upstream entries untouched. Add your entry above the upstream's latest, with the new bumped version. |
| **Release manifests** (versions.json, lerna.json, release-please config) | Same as version fields: upstream wins, then bump yours above. |

| Rationalization | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "Both versions are the same, so I can keep either" | The upstream entry represents a published release. Your entry represents unreleased work. Bump yours. |
| "I'll merge the changelog entries under one version" | Each version in a changelog represents a distinct release. Combining them rewrites release history. |
| "My version is higher, so I should keep mine" | Upstream was released first. Its version is now occupied. Bump yours above it. |

### Other special cases

| File type | Resolution approach |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Lock files** (package-lock.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, yarn.lock, Gemfile.lock, go.sum) | Accept either version, then regenerate: delete the lock file, run the package manager install, stage the new lock file |
| **Generated files** (.pb.go, .generated.ts, compiled assets) | Accept either version, then regenerate using the project's build command |
| **Import conflicts** | Keep both imports, remove duplicates, respect project ordering conventions |
| **Formatting-only conflicts** | Apply project formatting conventions consistently |

## Step 4: Stage Resolved Files

After resolving each file:

```bash
# For kept/merged files
git add <file>

# For deleted files
git rm <file>
```

## Step 5: Verify Resolution

Run in parallel:

```bash
# Confirm no conflict markers remain in the entire repo
git diff --check

# Verify all conflicts are resolved (should show no unmerged paths)
git status
```

**If conflict markers remain:** go back to Step 3 for the affected files.

### Verify both sides' changes are preserved (ALL operation types)

For **every** resolved conflict (not just during rebase), verify that both sides' meaningful changes survived:

1. **Review the resolved file** against each side's intent (identified in Step 2).
2. For each side, confirm:
   - Additions from that side are present in the resolved file (or were intentionally excluded with justification).
   - Modifications from that side are reflected in the resolved file.
   - Intentional removals from that side are still removed — code was not re-added by the other side's block.
3. If any meaningful change was silently dropped, re-open the file and restore it before continuing.

**During rebase — additional check for the commit being replayed:**

Get the SHA of the commit currently being applied:

```bash
git_dir=$(git rev-parse --git-dir)
cat "$git_dir/rebase-merge/stopped-sha" 2>/dev/null \
  || cat "$git_dir/rebase-apply/original-commit" 2>/dev/null
```

Then inspect what that commit intended:

```bash
git show <stopped-sha> --stat
git show <stopped-sha> -- <conflicted-file>
```

Confirm the intent of the feature branch commit is present in the resolved version.

| Rationalization | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "I checked the conflict markers, that's enough" | A conflict can be syntactically resolved but semantically wrong — one side's intent may be missing |
| "The merge compiled, so it's correct" | Compilation doesn't verify that both sides' behavioral changes are present |
| "I kept both sides' code so nothing was lost" | Keeping both sides can re-add intentionally deleted code, which is also a loss of intent |

**Detect and run type checker or linter** to catch semantic conflicts
(code that merges cleanly but is logically broken —
e.g., a function signature changed on one side while the other side calls it with old arguments).
Detection: check for `tsconfig.json` (-> `npx tsc --noEmit`), `mypy.ini`/`pyproject.toml` with mypy config (-> `mypy`),
`Cargo.toml` (-> `cargo check`), or a `lint` target in the Makefile (-> `make lint`). If none found, skip.

## Step 6: Report Results

Provide a summary:

```
Resolved N conflict(s):
- <file1>: <brief resolution description>
- <file2>: <brief resolution description>

Unresolved (if any):
- <file3>: left for manual resolution

To continue:
  merge:       git merge --continue
  rebase:      git rebase --continue
  cherry-pick: git cherry-pick --continue
  revert:      git revert --continue
```

### DO NOT Continue the Operation

**NEVER** automatically run `git merge --continue`, `git rebase --continue`, `git cherry-pick --continue`, `git revert --continue`, or `git commit` after resolving conflicts.

The user must review the resolutions and continue the operation manually.

| Rationalization | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "All conflicts are resolved, so it's safe to continue" | The user may want to review resolutions, run tests, or abort |
| "The user asked me to fix conflicts, which implies continuing" | Fixing conflicts and continuing the operation are separate actions |
| "It saves the user a step" | An unwanted merge commit or rebase is harder to undo than typing one command |

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Not a git repository | Inform the user and stop |
| No conflicts detected | Inform the user there are no conflicts to resolve. Stop. |
| Conflict state script fails | Fall back to `git status` and `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U` for manual detection |
| File too large to read | Focus on conflict marker sections using Grep to find `<<<<<<<` line numbers, then Read with offset/limit |
| Semantic conflict (compiles but logically wrong) | Flag the risk to the user: "These files merged cleanly but may have semantic conflicts — recommend running tests" |
| Lock file regeneration fails | Report the error. Suggest the user run the package manager manually. |
| User chooses "Leave unresolved" | Track the file and include it in the unresolved list in Step 6 |
